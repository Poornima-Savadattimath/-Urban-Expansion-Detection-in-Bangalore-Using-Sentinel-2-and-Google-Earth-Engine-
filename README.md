# -Urban-Expansion-Detection-in-Region of Interest(ROI)-Using-Sentinel-2-and-Google-Earth-Engine-
Description:
Developed a Python-based geospatial workflow using Sentinel-2 imagery and Google Earth Engine to detect and visualize urban expansion in ROI between 2018 and 2024. Applied cloud masking, calculated NDBI, and highlighted newly urbanized areas through Google Colab visualizations.

Tech Stack: Python · Google Earth Engine · geemap · Sentinel-2 · Remote Sensing · Google Colab

Key Features:

Automated cloud removal using SCL band filtering

Computation of Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)

Comparative visualization of urban areas across years

Ideal for city planning and environmental impact studies
